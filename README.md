# Python Programming: An Introduction
University of South Florida workshop  
Tuesday, February 20th, 2024  
9:00 - 10:30 am EST

This workshop will introduce the basics of Python, providing a foundation for beginners that are interested in working with data.

***

## Software Installation

We will program in Python using JupyterLab, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date web browser -- Chrome, Safari and Firefox are all supported.

You will also need to find the command line (aka terminal, shell) on your system. If you are not familiar with the command line on your system, you can find help [HERE](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html#open-a-new-shell).

To start the software, you will need to use your terminal to open a notebook. In your terminal type `jupyter notebook` - your terminal will fill with code and a new browser window will open with the Jupyter software. Click on `New` and `Python3`, and you are all ready to code in a new notebook! For more information about getting started, [HERE](https://datacarpentry.org/python-socialsci/index.html#setup-instructions-for-python) is a helpful document.

### Recommended Installation - Anaconda

Downloading Python and JupyterLab independently may often times run into issues that are tricky and time consuming to resolve. A simpler method of installing is to use the all-in-one installer Anaconda. It provides a user-friendly interface, allows easy access to Python packages, and is simple to install.

Download Anaconda - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Advanced User Software Installation

For **advanced users** that are familiar with the command line and prefer to install Python and JupyterLab individually, you can find the links and installation instructions on the software websites below.

### Python

There are two current versions of Python -- we will be using version 3.6 or later. 

Download Python 3.x - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### JupyterLab

Install JupyterLab by following the first set of instructions - [https://jupyter.org/jnstall](https://jupyter.org/install)
 

##  Additional Software Requirements (**for those NOT using Anaconda**)

We will be using the Python number array package, Numpy. It must be installed on your computer using the command line using the command `pip`. 

### Check that `pip` is installed correctly

* Getting started with pip [instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)
    - Note: You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` like the instructions indicate
    - Note: You may also need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`
* If `pip` is not installed or working, try following these instructions [HERE](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Install Numpy

* On command line, type: 
    - `pip install numpy`
